# Implementation Roadmap

## Overview
This roadmap outlines the phased approach to implementing the comprehensive travel platform, prioritizing core functionality while building toward advanced features. Each phase delivers measurable value while establishing the foundation for subsequent phases.

## Development Approach
- **Iterative Development**: Each phase delivers working features
- **Incremental Architecture**: Build upon existing Expo/React Native foundation
- **Continuous Integration**: Deploy and test early and often
- **User Feedback**: Validate features with real users before advancing
- **Parallel Development**: Some tasks can be developed concurrently
