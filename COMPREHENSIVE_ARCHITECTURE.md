## Component Architecture

### Design System Enhancement
Building on existing [`ThemedText`](components/themed-text.tsx) and [`ThemedView`](components/themed-view.tsx):

```typescript
// Enhanced component hierarchy
├── UI Foundation (Enhanced existing)
│   ├── Button, Input, Card, Avatar, Badge
│   └── Modal, Loading, Error Boundary
│
├── Form Components
│   ├── Date Picker, Location Picker, Image Picker
│   └── Rating Input, Validation Messages
│
├── Feature Components
│   ├── Listing Cards, Booking Calendar, Payment Form
│   ├── Chat Interface, Video Controls, Social Posts
│   └── Host Dashboard, Analytics Charts
│
└── Layout Components
    ├── Screen Wrapper, Bottom Sheet, Search Header
    └── Navigation Guards, Protected Routes
```

## Navigation Architecture

### Route Structure (Expo Router Enhanced)
```typescript
// Leveraging existing tab structure with enhancements
├── (auth)/          # Authentication flows
├── (onboarding)/    # First-time user setup
├── (tabs)/          # Main app - Enhanced existing structure
│   ├── index        # Discovery (enhanced existing)
│   ├── explore      # Search (enhanced existing) 
│   ├── bookings     # User bookings
│   ├── messages     # Chat interface
│   ├── social       # Social feed
│   └── profile      # User profile
├── (host)/          # Host-specific screens
├── listing/[id]     # Listing details
├── booking/         # Booking flows
└── chat/           # Messaging & video calls
```

## State Management Strategy

### Hybrid Approach
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[UI Components] --> B[Zustand Stores]
    A --> C[React Query]
    A --> D[Stream State]
    A --> E[RevenueCat State]
    
    B --> F[Auth, UI, Location]
    C --> G[API Data & Caching]
    D --> H[Chat & Social]
    E --> I[Subscriptions]
```

**Zustand**: Client-side state (auth, UI preferences, location)
**React Query**: Server state with intelligent caching and synchronization
**Stream SDKs**: Real-time chat and social features
**RevenueCat SDK**: Subscription and purchase management

## Performance & Scalability

### Optimization Strategy
- **Query Optimization**: React Query with strategic caching
